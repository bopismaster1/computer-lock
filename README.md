# computer-lock
it's a simple program, it will run on boot up so when you lock your computer and you experience unexpected shutdown  when boot up your computer will still be lock, you need to enter your password to unlock it,. (I use in on offiice lol) 

how you use:

extract the zip and open the application
you will see 3 icon below the date (Lock,Forbid, and close)

1st Click the lock Icon, then  it will show the lock window with 1 text box
available command to type in the textbox
1122- to run at startup
2211- to remove at startup
cpass- change password

2nd icon is forbidden icon
when you click this it will automatically close all kind of browser and prevent to open it
it will ask auth when you try ko stop  the forbidden browser 

and the last icon is close.:)
